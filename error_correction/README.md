In addition to the code in this folder and the json file, you will need the code "lc_equivalent" from Stefanos repo: https://github.com/StefanoPaesani/LossTolerance/blob/master/CodesFunctions/lc_equivalence.py.
The json file contains all the graphs up to 8 qubits that can be generated by the quantum dot and LC-operations and act as a catalouge.
