In addition to the code in this folder and the json files, you will need the code "lc_equivalent" from Stefanos repo: https://github.com/StefanoPaesani/LossTolerance/blob/master/CodesFunctions/lc_equivalence.py.
The json file "data_8_qubits_no_isomorph.json" contains all the graphs up to 8 qubits that can be generated by the quantum dot and LC-operations, and act as a catalouge.
The json file "graph_catalouge_6_qubits.json" is on a different format than "data_8_qubits_no_isomorph.json" and is needed in "generate_code". In "generate code" you generate error correction codes for a range of graphs. There are comments giving the ranges for all 6-qubit graphs, 5-qubit graphs and 4-qubit graphs.
Once a json file has been generated from "generate_code", use this file in decoder to get a plot of logical errors against physical errors. In the decoder you can also choose the noise channel by the parameters px and pz. These parameters stands for probability of X-error and Z-error, respectively.
