The json file "graph_catalouge_6_qubits.json" act as a catalouge for all graphs up to 6-qubits, and is needed in "generate_code" as well as in "decoder". In "generate code" you generate a json file with error correction codes for a range of graphs. There are comments giving the ranges for all 6-qubit graphs, 5-qubit graphs and 4-qubit graphs.
Once a json file has been generated from "generate_code", use this file along with "graph_catalouge_6_qubits.json" in "decoder" to get a plot of logical errors against physical errors. In the "decoder" you can also choose the noise channel by the parameters px and pz. These parameters stand for probability of X-error and Z-error, respectively.
