In addition to the code in this folder and the json files, you will need the code "lc_equivalent" from Stefanos repo: https://github.com/StefanoPaesani/LossTolerance/blob/master/CodesFunctions/lc_equivalence.py.
The json file "data_8_qubits_no_isomorph.json" contains all the graphs up to 8 qubits that can be generated by the quantum dot and LC-operations and act as a catalouge.
The json file "graph_catalouge_6_qubits.json" is on different format than "data_8_qubits_no_isomorph.json" add is needed in "generate_code". In "generate code" you decide a range of graphs to generate error correction codes for. There are comments giving the ranges for all 6-qubit graphs, 5-qubit graphs etc.
