# Graph_states_generation
Code for generating graph states. This requires Sam Moreleys repository "graph state compass (gsc)". Furtheremore, there is code for generating thecorresponding circuit that creates the given graph state from local complementation. Also implementing errors in the gate, changing to qudits.
