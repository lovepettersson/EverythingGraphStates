# Graph_states_generation
Code for generating graph states. This requires Sam Moreleys repository "graph state compass (gsc)". Furtheremore, there is code for generating the corresponding circuit that creates the given graph state from local complementation. Also implementing errors in the spin gates. To inculde excitation level "3" we are changing to qudits.
