# EverythingGraphStates
Code for doing a graph search including the time-bin entanglement protocol and local complementation. Furthermore, there is code for performing indirect measurements of the spin with a Monte Carlo error model drawing probabilities from experimental parameters. Finally, there is code to simulate Grover and Deutsch algorithm using four qubits graphs.
